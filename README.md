Hello! Welcome to my first project in The Odin Projects curriculum.

The goal of this project it to take everything I have learned so far using HTML to create a multi-page website for some food recipies! I know this is going to seem extremely beginner, and that's absolutely okay! I hope this is a good reminder that anyone can become a website developer.

The goal of this project is to showcase my current knowledge and understanding of HTML to start. Apparently we will be revisiting this project later down the road to add some styling using CSS. I look forward to this journey and am glad I took this step back into web development before continuing my studies into programming.

You can't learn to walk without crawling. Don't give up.
