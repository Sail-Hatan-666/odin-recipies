            <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Pre-heat your oven to 350&deg;</li>
                <li>Spray or coat your pan with a non-sticking cooking oil</li>
                <li>Open your first can of Pillsbury Croissants and roll flat. The dough will need to be pressed together at the seams as we are going to use it as one flat sheet</li>
                <li>Press the flattened dough into your oiled pan and let the edges sit up against the walls of the pan</li>
                <li>Stack your meat and cheese however you would like! We like to start with cheese, and adding until the bottom is covered, and then the same with the ham and follow these steps until you have your desired amount of mean and cheese!</li>
                <li>Roll out your second can of Pillsbury Croissants using the same technique as the last one</li>
                <li>Place the second sheet of dough on top, be sure to seal the edges around the pan</li>
                <li>Place the pan in the oven and cook for 10 - 15 minutes&#40;or until golden brown&#41;</li>
                <li>Finally, you can flip the final product onto a cutting board, and let cool before cutting and serving!</li>
